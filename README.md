👋 Hi, I’m Gian Z. (aka @seddboi)! I am a self-taught front end developer who is actively looking for a position in the field of Web development!
 
👀 My main focus at the moment is becoming a Full Stack/Python Expert 💯. I have a work-in-progress messaging application named Messengerer, that is meant to be a Facebook Messanger dupe, with a little more satire style! Follow my messengerer repository to see the progress build 👨🏽‍💻.

I am always available for any collabs! I try to be as active as can be on here, so do not be afraid to reach out to me!
My primary skills that I use daily: 
 - React
 - Node
 - Express 
 - SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
 - Material UI (has great React components)
 - Redux
 - Socket.io
 - Axios
 - JSON Web Tokens
 - Typescript
 - Python
 - and growing daily!

I am extremely appreciative of any comments/questions/concerns. I am also every more appreciative of any open source opportunities that I may be a part of. Reach me here:
